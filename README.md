### ![supermarket](Data/supermarket.png)

### **Project Overview**
#
For my final project of Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp I wanted to put myself in a real marketing case so I could see how to use all the knowledge gained during the bootcamp in a real business. 
  
This project shows a Customer Segmentation Analysis of a premium supermarket, having the aim of doing clusters of the clients' database to then target them with marketing campaigns in a proper way as well as launch innovations based on their profile and carry out promotions.
 
The data has been taken from a dataset in Kaggle called [Customer Personality Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis).

### **Process**
#
1. Data cleaning: eliminating unnecessary info and creating new key variables for the analysis.

2. Data pre-processing: preparing the data to do the unsupervised learning model with k-means, transforming the categorical data into ordinal using *One Hot Encoder* method. 

3. Unsupervised Learning: using the K-Means method to get the clusters. The result has been having 4 different clusters for the clients' database. 

4. Analysis of the clusters: identifying how the algorithm has divided my clusters looking at the characteristics of each with the help of data visualization. 

5. Loading the data into Tableau for visualization purposes. 

### **Tools & Techniques**
#
- Python (Pandas, Numpy)
- Data Visualization (Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Machine Learning (K-Means)
- Tableau

### **Conclusion & Learnings** 
#
The algorithm has divided my customers into 4 groups, based on their level of income and their loyalty level mainly.
